**Overview of the statistical analysis:**

- The purpose of the analysis is to create multiple worksheet using the data from bike-sharing NYC Citi Bike and start building a dashboard and creating a story using Tableau. We will then use this as a business proposal to present our findings for the City of Des Moines and stakeholders.

  

The two main difference from the Module 14 and the Module 14 Challenge are using the to_datetime from pandas to format the "trip duration" and exporting a edited CSV to Tableau and creating a new analysis.
